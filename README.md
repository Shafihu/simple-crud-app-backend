# Simple CRUD Application with Express, Node.js, and MongoDB

This repository contains a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. The application demonstrates fundamental operations on a MongoDB database through a RESTful API, providing a solid foundation for developing more complex back-end applications.

## Key Features:
- **Express.js**: A minimalist web framework for Node.js, used to set up the server and define API routes.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing and managing application data.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, used for data validation and easy interaction with the database.
- **CRUD Operations**: Implementation of Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities for managing data.
- **RESTful API**: The API endpoints follow REST principles, making it easy to interact with the application from a front-end or other services.
